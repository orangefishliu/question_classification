# question_classification

Classifying comments on online German-learning videos and trying to detect all the question
sentences. 

When a comment is left to ask questions under such knowledge-oriented videos, it often carries useful feedback for video producers to improve their programs or to build a closer connection between producers and audience. Detecting question sentences can, thus, potentially benefit both program hosts/makers and language learners.
