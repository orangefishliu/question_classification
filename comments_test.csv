FdPMeKnxln8,Meet the Germans Live with Rachel Stewart | Ask Me Anything | DW Euromaxx,"Lola Rennt and Wings of Desire are great German films! More film suggestions would be great. 

I am currently transcribing DW Deutsch segments and Interviews in German. 

Sometimes I go look at the Nuremberg trials and try to transcribe them each testimony is about 2 hours long. They give me darker aspects of the language that my app won‚Äôt teach me because I want to take the DLAB (defense language aptitude battery). 

So you have to study things about military topics, other morbid things like death and terrorism and attacks ETC. 

That‚Äôs why DW videos on the subject are a great help! That way next time one of our extremists are talking to one of yours and we get info they are planning an attack someone can notify your people and you can investigate it and prevent it. Even if we aren‚Äôt at war our military still talks to your military and we still have NATO to cooperate with. Apparently we still need to communicate about the 4chan extremists before they do something stupid. 

I love these live streams! I also loved your asparagus poem! I haven‚Äôt seen your rap video yet!

FdPMeKnxln8,Meet the Germans Live with Rachel Stewart | Ask Me Anything | DW Euromaxx,"Digitalization: At one point I spent a lot on eBay.de and eBay.ca/eBay.com getting vintage cameras. Germans usually expected direct payments to their bank. Americans and Canadians took one of the three most popular online systems (eBay, PayPal and Bidpay) the British preferred cheques and were reluctant to release bank account details for immediate transfer. There are very strict rules in German law about transaction times and safety. British banks were and are much slower with a transaction taking anything from a second to half a day. UK charges across currencies are also high - sending and receiving. Although I had an account in Germany for over 20 years I could not get an account that would allow me do online transfers only put that in writing and send in the post to them. I could open an account in Eire (who also use EUROS), but online transfers were restricted to Eire for non-residents. 

It seems the Germans do like to get the law in place, correct and working before they embrace new technologies in the digital world.",0

FdPMeKnxln8,Meet the Germans Live with Rachel Stewart | Ask Me Anything | DW Euromaxx,"Arguments in Germany: On my last day working in a factory in Germany I was moved to a different production line. Why I don't know. Maybe it was the natural end of production where I worked or closed for maintenance. For some reason that I failed to understand the person in charged wanted more things done at the end of the shift. Normally this would not matter but I had been paid off two hours before and really wanted to get into town for a last look before packing to return to England. It got worse because unlike my delightful colleagues who spoke in clear simple terms for me to understand he ranted on loudly and aggressively in an accent I could not follow. So I demanded that he explained what he wanted. He became rude. I swore back in German. No affect. So I swore back in English and that blew his top. Later in the changing rooms my former work mates came over and asked what the idiot has done to me. Some also expressed their dismay that I knew German swear words as in the months I spent with them I never used them or even reacted to them. 

When I was four a visitor came around to my Oma's home. I ran away to the bedroom. I thought a major argument was going on and that she was very angry over something. No it was just her normal way of speaking - loud and aggressive to my English ears at least. 

When my parents argued. Rather when my mother got upset and shouted, as my father never answered back,  she always spoke English. This was very different to her two German friends who married British ex-servicemen. They got angry in German.

My mother spoke English without an accent. My English accent in German is so strong that my cousin said he didn't understand me when I spoke English when I had spoken to him in German.",0

When I moved to Germany I had a A2.1 level, but my listening and speaking war sooo weak that I got back to A1.2. I went from A1.2 to C1 in 7 months. By then I was able to speak to everyone about mostly everything. I was attending job interviews in German, I did a marketing course in German (economy, math, marketing and communication, market research, etc...). In the opposite scenario, I have a friend who was already living in Germany for a year by the time I got there. I left 16 months later, and she was still in B1.2, and could not speak in the same level I could. All that to say that people are different, the learning process is different.

FdPMeKnxln8,Meet the Germans Live with Rachel Stewart | Ask Me Anything | DW Euromaxx,"The question about the cows in Argentina has an easy answer: about as many as grains of sand on German beaches!  :)

The beer is not sooo much a question of loyalty to one brand, rather with the system/tradition. The typical bar or restaurant has a supplier contract with a single (frequently local) brewery or distributor, so on tap they only have that brand's beer (multiple varieties though). You can often get several national brands in bottles too, and often the brewery has a collaboration with another and so you can get Altbier (from D√ºsseldorf) on tap pretty much across the country. There are also specialty beer pubs that have a variety on tap, but those are indeed specialty pubs. When going out, Germans mostly drink their preferred beer (the beer drinkers ARE loyal to their brand!), so for most pubs it makes little sense to offer more variety. But that's changing a bit.

Regarding smalltalk, I think the main difference is that Germans like to actually discuss issues; instead of just superficial conversation we like to probe the depths of a topic, which can lead to quite an argument sometimes :)",0

FdPMeKnxln8,Meet the Germans Live with Rachel Stewart | Ask Me Anything | DW Euromaxx,"So let's talk about the thing with the cash.
Remember how once upon a time, there were two Germanys, precisely in the area, where you find Germany now?
Well, after the Nazis, the east-most part of Germany saw an other regime - the German Democratic Republic.

Frankly, after they saw three regime changes (from Weimar Republic to Third Reich to GDR to FRD - to use English abbreviations),
all within one century (actually there was one more change from the Kaiserreich to the Weimar Republic, which I didn't count because the people who've seen it are all dead),
after so many system changes, you kind of lose faith that the current government form is bound to stay forever.
¬†
Now - two of these five systems having been built upon what one could describe as ideological fanaticism,
they did not put the emphasis on human rights, freedom of press and data security, but rather relied on brute force,
or in the GDR's case, a well renowned intelligence agency, which transgressed into basically - 
children getting out of trouble,by stalking their classmates for the government.

So people in the east are pretty preoccupied, and also, when the Stasi was still in place, people in the west heard about that,
and also got quite preoccupied, to the point where you could say - we have well founded trust issues.
Basically, back when the government did a count on the people, there was almost riot in the air.
Now we do have social media, and even though we do have concerns, we use them, especially my generation has kind of adopted 
the reckless carelessness, that you can find throughout the world - but 1984 - for many Germans - is not too far from their real memories.

Sure, there was less CCTV than you have in modern London, Big Data was not a thing - but already,
if your neighbours picked up you saw 'west-radio' you could get in serous trouble. 
Kids were asked whether they could recognise the tunes and melodies of FRD news and popular shows in school,
and if they did, they might get in trouble for that.

So the Stasi didn't have credit card data, nor Facebook or Payback or anything.
They did not have massive CCTV.
Now imagine if they had had all this technology.

Would you want to move to such a country?

Basically the GDR was worse than Russia, by far, now imagine you dump Facebook, Big Data and CCTV surveillance into that bowl.
Hack, we even had a Mexican borderwall, some American please imagine, if you had a wall going right through Nashville and Indianapolis,
and everything east of that was to be controlled by Russians.

So yeah, we're a bit weary at times, and cash could have been a health risk in CoVid times, 
but turns out you don't get contaminated too easily from touching objects, and we got away quite well.

But in my humble opinion, we should be weary.
The Americans have elected Trump, an incompetent, though still very dangerous imbecile once, and they might yet do it again.
Facebook, Google, Amazon and Paypal. They are all based in Silicon valley to my knowledge.
Little are they controlled by the government, and if asked, they have to report to the FBI.

What do you make from that, with regards to the protection of the freedom of press?

Tik Tok, as I am well aware, is not the better alternative.
In fact I would cast my trust only in the EU, and even that, only after some more solid reforms.
But if we could have a cross European social network, that would actually probably be quite nice.

Until then, I will remain a bit weary on social media, (even though I have just stated a very clear opinion on Google owned YouTube),
probably prefer cash payments in many situations, and avoid online shopping a little bit.

FdPMeKnxln8,Meet the Germans Live with Rachel Stewart | Ask Me Anything | DW Euromaxx,"I'm really upset with me because I missed the lifestream but fortunately, I could now stop and jump on the points that trigger me IMHO you made the point when you stated (at your back in Britain video) that when you are feeling more forgivin both sides can grow. Culture is not math there is always more than one right way to do things. Because of your question about the recommendation for local differences in Germany, that would depend on the overall topic or more precisely the way you would like to tell the story. If you are looking for a global audience you should focus more on the obvious differences eg. Hamburg vs Munich, (let's say Ina M√ºller and Uschi Glas) if you are more into the idea to explain why our neighbors did have different names for us that vary from Dutch over Allemagne and Saxian to Niemcy or Tyskland. So in the end, it depends on the approach you will have in mind. As someone who was born and raised at the Lower Rhine, but has traveled the whole Nation as a salesman for decades, I would prefer a historical background approach, which takes the differences of the many Germanic tribes into account. And if you would take this idea I would start with the Walhalla in Donaustauf and than go to some places that represent the unification process like the Paulskirche in Frankfurt/Main or the Hambacher Burg, followed by places that did represent the unified German Empire eg. Wacht am Rhein or Deutsches Eck in Koblenz.",0

FdPMeKnxln8,Meet the Germans Live with Rachel Stewart | Ask Me Anything | DW Euromaxx,"I can relate to your comment about how learning a language organically, (that is learning it without any prior knowledge of it while living in the country) often works out better than when you‚Äòve studied it formally. I am a 56 year old lady who lives in Adelaide, Australia. When I was 16 years old, I spent a year in Norway as an exchange student. I knew absolutely no Norwegian when I got there, but over time with some wonderful help from the families I was staying with, I learnt to speak fluent conversational Norwegian. I remember feeling so pleased with myself that everyone was so impressed that I could speak Norwegian well. My background is actually German, my father came to Australia from Germany (Bavaria) after the war. However he didn‚Äòt and wouldn‚Äòt teach us children German. As I‚Äòve gotten older I‚Äòve been interested in exploring my German background more. So I went back to uni and learnt German for 3 years to B2 level. I then applied to attend a language school in Stuttgart at the beginning of 2019. I had expected to be able to speak fluent German almost from the time I stepped off the plane. It just didn‚Äòt work that way. üò™ Even after the 6 weeks at the language school I still couldn‚Äòt speak it fluently. ‚òπÔ∏è I think the host lady I stayed with in Stuttgart thought I‚Äòd be better at speaking it too as I had been learning it at uni. I think that pressure actually makes it worse.  üòï
 I reconnected with some long lost relatives in Bavaria, and I was hoping to be able to speak to them in fluent German, and I think they thought I‚Äòd be able to speak better German too, but I couldn‚Äòt. üòï However with them, luckily it didn‚Äòt matter as we were just so excited to see each other after nearly 4 decades.  üòÉüéâ
I sort of wish there was some organic way for me to learn German, but at my age I think it‚Äòs probably a bit too hard to find a job, or a way) to live in Germany so I can learn it while I live there. üòè (I think I‚Äòve left my learning of German a bit late üòï)",0

FdPMeKnxln8,Meet the Germans Live with Rachel Stewart | Ask Me Anything | DW Euromaxx,"Hi Rachel. Unfortunately I missed the live stream but managed to watch the recorded version soon after - Loved it - great all round content!! I'm an Australian with German heritage & several rellies still in Germany (mostly around Berlin & Cologne). I've visited Germany many times & like you LOVE the country, despite what seems to be some quirky/strange customs to us from the english-speaking world. Like you, most of their customs work well and once you get used to them, I find I mostly prefer their method than what we use back in Australia. I love the mature attitude towards the acceptance of alcohol - being able to walk the street with a beer in your hand without getting fined and because of this relaxed attitude, I'm often amazed how few alcohol-fuelled violence there appears to be. It seems Germans mostly have a some drinks, get happy & go home. The lack of access to credit/debit card acceptance across Germany (and their love of cash) was at first inconvenient (& somewhat surprising) given their uptake for other technology, however it is slowly getting better with supermarkets at least now all accepting credit cards - restaurants are another matter.....
Their fanaticism over their garbage recycling is amazing (& quite stressful for first timers), but once you get used to it, makes sense.  We in Australia have just introduced bottle refund collection machines, allowing us to collect our glass, plastic & metal containers and cash them in for a refund - and it's very popular over here now.  The unusual (mostly written) request for males to sit while going to the toilet (urinating) again seemed quite over the top but I now find that I do this at home.....
In short, it is a great country & by far my favourite O/S destination. Love Berlin and Cologne, also big fans of Binz, Trier, Berchtesgaden, Nuremburg, Dresden and Magdeburg. My wife and I have contemplated moving over their for 6 month stints when we retire.
